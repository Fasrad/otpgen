otpgen is a program for generating cryptographic one-time-pads.

Lacking all rigor, it is recommended only for educational and amusement purposes. 

otpgen uses /dev/urandom as it's source of random digits. Depending 
on who you ask, /dev/urandom may or may not be random enough for 
cryptographic purposes depending on the entropy available in the 
system's entropy pool, and no effort is currently made to check this.

otpgen writes the resulting files to the working directory, which should not 
be a problem if you are e.g. using a liveCD on a diskless air-gapped dedicated system
(see: raspberry pi)
