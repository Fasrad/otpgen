otpgen is a program for generating cryptographic one-time-pads.

Lacking all rigor, it is recommended only for educational and amusement purposes. 

otpgen uses /dev/urandom as it's source of random digits. Depending 
on who you ask, /dev/urandom may or may not be random enough for 
cryptographic purposes depending on the entropy available in the 
system's entropy pool, and no effort is currently made to check this.

otpgen writes files to /tmp which is laughably insecure, however if 
you are e.g. using a liveCD on a diskless air-gapped dedicated system
(see: raspberry pi), then it shouldn't be a problem, so it remains.
