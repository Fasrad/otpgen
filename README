otpgen.sh is a program for generating cryptographic one-time-pads.

otpgen.pl is a program to speed the encryption and decryption of 
one-time-pad-encrypted messages.

Lacking all rigor, these programs are recommended only for educational 
and amusement purposes. 

otpgen uses /dev/urandom as it's source of random digits. Output from 
/dev/urandom may or may not be random enough for cryptographic purposes 
depending on the entropy available in the system's entropy pool, and 
no effort is currently made to check this.

otpgen writes the resulting files to the working directory, which should not 
be a problem if you are e.g. using a liveCD on a diskless air-gapped dedicated system
(see: raspberry pi)
