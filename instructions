HOW TO USE A ONE-TIME PAD, BY HAND

One-time pad encryption is absolutely unbreakable, provided:
--the pad is random
--the pad is never reused, even in part
--the pad remains secret

The truly paranoid do not trust any automatic encryption scheme. The truly 
paranoid must assume that all computer systems are compromised either through 
operating system compromises, exploited bugs, malware, keyloggers, powerline 
noise analysis, Van Eyck phreaking, backdoors hidden in CPU microcode, embedded 
3G modems hidden in silicon phoning home to the alien reptillion human hybrid 
conspiracy, HAARP subverting random.org by injecting information into atmospheric 
noise, etc. Thus, the only way to be really sure is to encrypt your message 
manually before even typing it into a computer.  

---ENCRYPTING A MESSAGE BY HAND---
0. Decide what section of pad to use. Since the pad must never be reused, and 
is ideally destroyed after being used, a convention must be established ahead 
of time to prevent you and your counterpart from using the same section of 
pad (e.g. Alice uses even pages to encrypt outgoing messages and Bob uses odd 
pages to encrypt outgoing messages). You can communicate instructions regarding the 
pad to be used "in the open" along with your message, but you cannot rely on 
that as a system because Bob might have have already used that same section of pad before he receives your message, and he may have already destroyed it.  

1. Write down your plaintext message. Remove all spaces. Remove all 
punctuation; spell out STOP or PARAGRAPH if you really need punctuation. 
Use all-caps, A-Z. Spell out all numbers either in English or your 
favorite spelling alphabet.

2. For each digit of your message, add the numerical value of your plaintext 
digit to the numerical value of the one-time-pad digit. If the result of 
the addition goes bigger than 25, then "wrap around" back to A and keep going 
(e.g. 24=Y, 25=Z, 26=A, 27=B, etc.)

3. Send the message 

4. According to your level of confidence and paranoia, destroy the pad used to send the message. 

---DECRYPTING A MESSAGE BY HAND---
0. Decide what section of pad the message was encrypted with, either through established
convention or by following the instructions sent with the message

1. For each digit of the ciphertext, subtract the numerical value of the one-time-pad 
digit from the numerical value of the the ciphertext digit. If the result of the 
subtraction is a negative number, then "wrap around" and keep going 
(e.g. 1=B, 0=A, -1=Z, -2=Y, etc.) The result is the recovered plain text message.

3. According to your level of confidence and paranoia, destroy the pad used to decrypt the message.
